Sorting algorithm is an act of arranging
elements or numbers in ascending or
descending order. It is useful for the
standardization of data. In this project,
we were able to carry out different types
of sorting algoritms such as: bubble sort,
insertion sort, quick sort, selection sort,
etc. We were able to calculate Big O notation,
which deals with the calculation of time
complexity of the function/algorithm.
